# machine-translator-project

This repo contains the implementation files of an English to French translator using neural networks, I developed 5 models: from a basic RNN model to a one more complex, mixing the best from previous models (bidirectional RNN, embeddings and encoder-decoder models).
It was the second project for the Udacity's Natural Language Processing Nanodegree.
