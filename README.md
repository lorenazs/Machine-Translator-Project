# English to French translator using neural networks

This repo contains the implementation files of an **English to French translator using neural networks**, I developed 5 models: from a basic RNN model to a one more complex, mixing the best from previous models (bidirectional RNN, embeddings and encoder-decoder models).  
**Technologies**:  Python, Keras and TensorFlow
It was the second project for the Udacity's Natural Language Processing Nanodegree.
Contents:
* machine_translation.ipynb - the Jupyter notebooks with the code
* machine_translation_v2.html  - the html version of the notebook
* images - a directory with the graphic model to implement, all the images are from the original project file provided by Udacity.com
